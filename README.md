## Welcome to Kanbanno!

Kanbanno is a single page appplication modelled after [Trello](https://trello.com "Trello"). It runs on the [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban "Kanban") system developed by engineers at Toyota, which presents an intuitive interface for its users to stay informed on the progression of their projects and quickly update the status of tasks.

## Technologies

* Backend: Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL
* Frontend: React/Redux
* Hosting: Heroku
* Other libraries: 
  * [react-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) for icons
  * [react-onclickoutside](https://github.com/Pomax/react-onclickoutside) for user interaction with menus

## Features

### User Authentication

Visitors go through a simple, no-nonsense, yet visually appealing signup process designed to get them set up with Kanbanno and let them focus on what matters more: getting their projects in shape.

Alternatively, visitors can feel free to demo the app to see if Kanbanno is the right fit for them.

### Boards, Lists*, and Cards*
\*Features under construction

The foundation of the app. Users can create boards for their projects and group the project's tasks (cards) in lists. Most often, users may want to group cards by their tasks' status (e.g. planning, not started, in progress, done).

Users will also be able to add details, such as descriptions and due dates, to cards to describe a task.

### Drag-and-Drop*

\* Feature under construction

Users will be able to rearrange their lists and cards around a board by simply dragging them around, just like an actual bulletin board.

### Sharing*

\* Feature under construction

Boards can be shared with a team so everyone can stay informed about the progression of their project. Team members can interact with lists and cards just like the board's owner.
